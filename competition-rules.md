#### Description
Create an application that allows a company to create a new event for a cyber security incident. While it is up to said company to determine what warants an event, they need to be able to track whatever events they create. This includes collecting information and evidence about that event. Some information will be collected on creation of the event automatically and some needs to be able to be inputed by the company. 

Once an event is created the company needs to be able to add status tags to the event for tracking purposes. Once an event is complete the item must be able to be marked complete, closed, and then logged for historical purposes.

### Rules

- No more then 60% of the code can be written by either David or Tony on their applicable teams
  - This allows for Hank and Brandon to get practice and be more involved
  - This will be checked using githubs available tools
- Code MUST be commented well. A 3rd party needs to be able to walk through it in a traditional code review setting.
- As a gentlemens agreement try to use chat gpt as little as possible.
  - If you are both stuck on something and it is gating you from completing something you may use it after you have exhausted other means.
  - It will be easy to see the difference between your code and chat GPTs code.
- The ChatGPT rule applies for code found online. While you are more than welcome to use online resources the idea is that you learn, not copy.
- The application needs to be completed on time. (Enter time constraint here)
  - For everyday that the application is completed late you will lose a points.
- Each teams repositories should be private and control access using GitHubs tools. This prevents the other team from accessing the others code.
